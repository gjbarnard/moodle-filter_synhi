Introduction
============

A syntax highlighter filter for Moodle with the choice of either EnlighterJS or SyntaxHighlighter
as the 'engine'.  The administrator has 'preview' settings to see what the look will be on example
code before the saving.

When active, content with a 'code' tag or 'pre code' tags within a course, module or block will be highlighted.
Specifically between the [Course and Block contexts](https://docs.moodle.org/39/en/Context).

Features
========
* Syntax Highlighting.

Usage
=====

Prior to version 39.1.0, the 'pre' tag was accepted on its own for code to be highlighted.  This proved problematic with the need
to have non-code preformatted but not highlighted.  To highlight code now, please use the 'code' tag, and surround with a 'pre' tag
to indicate a block of code.  With 'EnlighterJS', using a 'code' tag on its own indicates 'inline' code.  'SyntaxHighlighter' will
highlight the code in a block regardless of if there is an enclosing 'pre' tag.

Please add any configuration attributes to the 'code' tag.  Such as '[EnlighterJS - HTML Attribute Options (local)](https://github.com/EnlighterJS/documentation/blob/master/development/Options.md#html-attribute-options-local)' or for SyntaxHighlighter, please look at the information on the settings page.

For example
-----------

### Single line

`<code data-enlighter-language="java" class="brush: java">System.out.println("SynHi");</code>`

### Muiltiple lines

```
<pre><code data-enlighter-language="java" class="brush: java">
   package test;

   public class Test {
      private final String name = "Java program";

      public static void main (String args[]) {
         Test us = new Test();
         System.out.println(us.getName());
      }

      public String getName() {
         return name;
      }
   }
</code></pre>
```

Installation
============
 1. Ensure you have the version of Moodle as stated above in 'Required version of Moodle'.  This is essential as the
    filter relies on underlying core code that is out of my control.
 2. Login as an administrator and put Moodle in 'Maintenance Mode' so that there are no users using it bar you as the administrator.
 3. Copy the extracted 'synhi' folder to the '/filter/' folder.
 4. Go to 'Site administration' -> 'Notifications' and follow standard the 'plugin' update notification.
 5. Put Moodle out of Maintenance Mode.

Upgrading
=========
 1. Ensure you have the version of Moodle as stated above in 'Required version of Moodle'.  This is essential as the
    filter relies on underlying core code that is out of my control.
 2. Login as an administrator and put Moodle in 'Maintenance Mode' so that there are no users using it bar you as the administrator.
 3. Make a backup of your old 'synhi' folder in '/filter/' and then delete the folder.
 4. Copy the replacement extracted 'synhi' folder to the '/filter/' folder.
 5. Go to 'Site administration' -> 'Notifications' and follow standard the 'plugin' update notification.
 6. If automatic 'Purge all caches' appears not to work by lack of display etc. then perform a manual 'Purge all caches'
   under 'Home -> Site administration -> Development -> Purge all caches'.
 7. Put Moodle out of Maintenance Mode.

Uninstallation
==============
 1. Put Moodle in 'Maintenance Mode' so that there are no users using it bar you as the administrator.
 2. Go to Site administration -> Plugins -> Filters -> Manage filters.
 3. Click on 'Uninstall' and follow the on screen instructions.
 4. Put Moodle out of Maintenance Mode.

Reporting Issues
================
Before reporting an issue, please ensure that you are running the current version for your release of Moodle.  It is essential
that you are operating the required version of Moodle as stated at the top - this is because the theme relies on core
functionality that is out of its control.

I operate a policy that I will fix all genuine issues for free.  Improvements are at my discretion.  I am happy to make bespoke
customisations / improvements for a negotiated fee.

It is essential that you provide as much information as possible, the critical information being the contents of the theme's
version.php file.  Other version information such as specific Moodle version, theme name and version also helps.  A screen shot
can be really useful in visualising the issue along with any files you consider to be relevant.
